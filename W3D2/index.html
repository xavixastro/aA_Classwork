    <h2>Description</h2>
        <a name="des-tag" />
        <p>Lasagne, or the singular lasagna, commonly refers to an Italian cuisine dish made with stacked layers of this flat pasta
        alternated with sauces and ingredients such as meats, tomato sauce and other vegetables, cheese (which may include
        ricotta and parmesan), and seasonings and spices such as garlic, oregano and basil. The dish may be topped with melted
        grated mozzarella cheese.[2] Typically, the cooked pasta is assembled with the other ingredients and then baked in an
        oven. The resulting lasagne casserole is cut into single-serving square portions.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 375ยบ. In a large pot of salted boiling water, cook pasta according to package directions until al dente,
                less 2 minutes. Drain and drizzle a bit of olive oil to prevent noodles from sticking together.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, in a large pot over medium-high heat, heat oil. Cook ground beef until no longer pink, breaking up with a
                wooden spoon, then drain fat. Return beef to skillet and add garlic and oregano and stir for 1 minute. Season with salt
                and pepper, then add marinara and stir until warmed through.</li>
                <li>Combine ricotta, 1/4 cup Parmesan, and parsley in a large mixing bowl and season with salt and pepper. Set aside.</li>
                <li>In a large casserole dish, spread a thin layer of meat sauce, a single layer of lasagna noodles, a layer of ricotta
                mixture, and a single layer of mozzarella, then repeat layers. Top last layer of noodles with meat sauce, Parmesan, and
                mozzarella.</li>
                <li>Cover with foil and bake for 15 minutes, then increase temperature to 400ยบ and bake uncovered for 18 to 20 minutes.
